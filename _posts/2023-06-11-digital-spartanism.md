Hello again! I missed writing in May entirely. Life got busy and while I had interesting pontifications bouncing around my head, nothing really solidified. So I skipped it. Regarding monthly topics; on one hand I did great and on the other I totally let my themes go. Despite what I planned last month, to divide my topics into 2 to 3 different areas, I think this backfired and made me focus in on one to the detriment of the others. I did very little to learn Go/Javascript and almost entirely let my workout routine stop. This doesn't mean I didn't workout, but it was sporadic and uncoordinated, and there were weeks at a time I did nothing to "rest up" or get more sleep. On the other hand, baring a few days during busy travel work weeks, I made deliberate and consistent progress learning ROS and robotics almost every day! I *did* keep ROS as my topic for May and I think the focus helped. I'm sort of on a roll so I think I will continue with ROS for a third month, and then perhaps give up selecting topics all together. The fact is there was always be a half a dozen interests I wan't to pursue, and while I will take time to write and reflect on them to keep some focus, It's eating at me saying I'll do one thing and then bouncing around again. Still not sure how to solve this...but I don't have any time pressure to do so either...we'll see what happens. 

**Digital Spartainism**

The title of this months post is an idea I've had floating around in my head for a while but never put digital pen to paper. [^1] Please read this version of this article with a grain of salt, because I think I need to bounce this idea off others to refine what I mean by this, and come up with other examples to solidify the principle before I can decide if it is valuable and adopt it. [^2] The idea of spartanism is attractive in that stripping your life down to the absolute essentials lets you focus in on the what really matters and get things done. Productivity in this perspective is almost impossible in modern society because not only do we rely on so many physical objects for daily life, the complexity of systems requires abstractions so layered, that literally no single person can see the whole of the system in question. While I mean this in a very general sense, to include (but certainly not limited to) political systems, physical systems, economic systems, or any other system you might care to imagine, I'm particularly interested in the case of computer systems and the networks that connect them. 

A grecian Spartan would never own a computer. the idea of a fragile, finicky piece of hardware, complex and abstracted from the simple reality would not be a tool of value. But their society was not of the technical complexity of our own where you cannot exist without interfacing with the digital. So if there something of the spartan idea that, given a baseline of material equipment that is required, we can keep as simple as possible to maximize our effectiveness? After all, even Spartans had their cloak, shield, spear and xiphos. The tools required by the society are only a matter of degree. 

Working as a programmer and technologist, I understand we are always aiming to optimize our workflows for speed and efficiency. Tools exist that individuals adopt as a prefernce to other tools there are certianly standards that have developed
