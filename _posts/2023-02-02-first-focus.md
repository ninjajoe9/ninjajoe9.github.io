### Go(lang) get some Java(script) and get working!

Ok, so after much thought and contemplation I think the first monthly attention topic for this year will be *programming*. I heavily debated picking ROS as my topic, but at the end of the day learning and working with Go and Javascript will be incredibly beneficial both personally and professionally, so I'm going to give it the majority of my attention. In all likelihood I'll probably continue working with ROS as well, it just won't be my topic of choice.

What this looks like is making my own personal project with a Javascript frontend and Go backend in a similar architecture to my company's main software product line. I don't anticipate this will be done within the month (far from it), but I'll make a concerted effort to direct my spare time and attention to chipping away at it. 

Step 1 (probably this month) will just be learning a bunch of stuff. More Javascript, more Go, more HTML/CSS.
Step 2 will be working on a simple D20 generator (and maybe campaign story tracker?) for Dungeons & Dragons. (probably just a website with javascript)
Step 3 will be a ROS robot interface for controlling a number of my robots. 

This will let me spill into next month's topic of ROS2 learning. (maybe even April ....and May as well... since I might be traveling a bit for work)

We'll see how it goes! Wish me luck!
