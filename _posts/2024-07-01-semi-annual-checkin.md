Halfway through 2024 all ready. It's going too fast! This is only my second post this year. This is not to say I haven't done anything this year I just haven't shared it. Both work and my personal life have had a number of exciting events and I think my priorities are just focused inwardly. 

To name a few things I've Accomplished:
- Level A1 Japanese Language Certification on Busu
- Amateur Extra Radio License certification
- Stuck to a new work out schedule 
- read 3-4 books a month since January (and 5 in June!)
- invested more deeply in programming knowledge and hardware building skills
- upgraded my workshop setup
- 5-6 work trips 
- Lots and lots of Radio related projects
- Implemented process and systems for streamlining life, work and productivity in general

So I'd say I've accomplished quite a bit. 

looking back at my [And a Happy New Year]() post, there was still quite a bit I wanted to do. Some of these things don't make too much sense with the momentum I've picked up in other areas, but others aren't too far from being altered. 

to refocus, here is a list of goals/projects for the next 6 months. 
- Build a Personal Website
- Return to Martial Arts
- Write more on various topics (keep going with this blog)
- More with ROS and actually getting my robots running
- Learn more of and play with Rust
- Continue with Japanese 
- CW Radio 

I think even this short list might be beyond my capability in the next six months to accomplish something meaningful for every single item, so I'll have to reflect and prioritize. If I know myself at all I also know some of these will occur on a whim to spite the one's I've specifically programmed. C'est la vie. 

I suppose I am coming to a sad realization that despite only being in my mid-30's, there truly will not be enough time to experience all the things I want to do in life no matter how long I life. There is some philosophical reflection I need to sit with to really make sure I'm using my time most fully *and* simultaneously not burning myself out so I can keep enjoying the things I am doing. More on this later. The concept of "Purpose" comes to mind. 

I'll check in again next quarter. ~JL
