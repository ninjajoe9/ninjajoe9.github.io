Merry Christmas everyone! (and a happy new year!)

I haven’t written in a few months (and honestly don’t feel too bad about it!) but thought I would write an end of year note as a way to set priorities for the year to come!

I would be remiss not to mention some of the last years projects and accomplishment and how they might inform next years. 

Here was last years list from [2023-01-13-a-year-later](https://ninjajoe9.github.io/a-year-later/):
- ROS
- Calisthenics
- ~~Japanese Language~~
- HAM Radio
- ~~Writing~~
- ~~Drawing~~
- Hacking

If I added a strike through I did very little with it in 2023. ROS, Started strong but then Identified a few deficiencies, and despite committing hard for a few deliberate months, lost the taste and fell off. I would very much like to try at that again this year, but I need to put WAAY less pressure on myself. 

Calisthenics - Started strong, got hurt…Now in PT and starting back in the Gym. Rucking too. I’m going to get my fitness life back in shape this year, but to what end I know not…yet. 

Japanese. Wanted to a lot. Didn’t. Oh well. Maybe my want will be more this year. 

HAM. Surprising did quite a bit! I think I’ll be getting my Extra License in January! Very close! Then probably some packet radio and HF digital modes. Should be fun, but I’m not focusing or stressing it. 

Writing. No. Drawing. A little, but not much. Maybe I’ll try to keep it in my brain to pick up a notebook more. 

Hacking! Some! Flipper Zero and web tools mostly. Learning a ton about networking from work and Linux in general so always good new skills. Work might have quite a bit more of this in the coming year as well. Excited! 

On to this year! Just gonna list some stuff and clean it up later I'll know what I mean by these and won't explain too much. If it gets acomplished maybe I'll write a post about it...

- Digitally Distributed Republic (blockchain for citizenship/equity/membership)
- Pick up Art of Impossible again
- Vailock 2.0 (in rust!)
- Functional Fitness
- Japanese (including writing!)
- Solitaire
- Rust programming
- Universal Hacking platform
- polyphasic sleep
- time tracking
- Amateur Radio 
- MORE ROBOTS!!!
- Getting stuff done

That's all for now. On a completely unrelated note check out [this episode](https://youtu.be/Wgh8Gfs2S7M?si%253Dw1C_igpGcX96X_X-) of The Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green, and the [most recent episode](https://youtu.be/A1QWAJ8vWtA?si%253DRwn6TbYnXhQkB0as)) of the Modem Prometheus podcast. Finally, leave a Hot Chocolate out side your door this new year. You never know who might need it!
