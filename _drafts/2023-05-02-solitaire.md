As usual, fist, my monthly update:
**Physical Topic** - shoulder strength and mobility
    - Last month went so-so and I was inhibited by travel and motivation. I skipped many days but tried to at least get some cardio and stretching in every day. When I was traveling and had access to a Gym I was able to do a handful of full body exercises involving minimal strength training, but I'm starting to think strength training again may not be something I can do right until I join a gym again.
    - For this month I will refocus on calisthenics and shoulder strength/mobility. No real change to the cardio and flexibility plans but for strength the goal is to increase my ability to hold my weight in my shoulders alone for 30 seconds or greater. Even after 3-5 seconds smokes me. Eventually this will go from shoulder hold on a matt, to a frog stand, to eventually, a handstand. 

**Mental Topic** - ROS2 redux
    - Last month went fairly well finding the time to revive my ROS brain and refresh all the knowledge I had upon my last use of ROS and made some long strides learning about modeling and simulation in Rviz and Gazebo. I haven't had any progress with any actual hardware last month other then setting up a RasPi for testing and use this month. 
    - For this month I plan to model and simulate a single servo actuator and try to get it running with wiringpi directly connected to the GPIO pins. (this may be futile, but I want to avoid having an extra driver board communicating over serial because 2 of my current robots work directly from RasPi GPIO and it would reduce the steps I would have to take to add additional hardware to these bots.) If that is successful I will do the same thing, but with a single driver board for the servos on my robot arm, and if that works it will be fairly straight forward to get the whole robot arm working in ROS, just a matter of taking the time to do it. \
