Wow....four months later... lets see all that has happened since then:
- wrapped up 2 tough class projects
- graduated (yay!)
- got a job
- finished the sak&#233
- traveled all overthe country for various work things (all awesome) 
- Got my UAS pilots license (and played with a bunch of drones)
- probably a lot more that I'm missing 

Anyway, I'm not too upset with myself for not writing, but it's ironic my last post that was suppose to highlight the first quarter of the year and emphasis focus, I have been so focused I haven't even written for a whole quarter. No worries. I'll get back to it from time to time.
